    	\section1 Description
	
            The Qt SOAP project provides basic web service support
            with version 1.1 of the SOAP protocol.
        

	
	    The SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) component recognizes
	    the XML standard for describing how to exchange messages. Its
	    primary usage is to invoke web services and get responses from
            Qt-based applications.

            These classes make it easy to construct, send, receive and
            process SOAP messages on the client side.
