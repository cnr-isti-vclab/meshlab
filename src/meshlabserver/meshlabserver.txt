meshlabserver [logargs] [args]


  where logargs can be:

    -d filename         dump on a text file a list of all the
                        filtering functions
    -l filename         log of the filters is output on a file


  where args can be:

    -p filename         meshlab project (.mlp) to be loaded

    -w filename [-x]    output meshlab project (.mlp) to be saved.
                        If -x flag is specified a 3D model meshfile.ext
                        contained in the input project will be 
                        overwritten, otherwise it will be saved in the 
                        same directory of input mesh as a new file 
                        called meshfile_out.ext.
                        ALL the mesh attributes will be exported in the
                        saved files

    -i filename         mesh that has to be loaded

    -o filename [-l <opt_layer>][-m <opt_mask>]  the name of the file 
                        where to write the current layer of the project
                        If -l parameter is set the specified layer is
                        going to be saved with the chosen filename
                        Valid values for <opt_layer> can be:
                          [0,last_layer_in_the_project] to indicate the
                             desired layer by its index
                          c  to indicate the CURRENT layer in the project
                          x  to indicate the LAST layer in the project
                        If -l param is not specified, by default the 
                        CURRENT layer will be saved
                        If -m is specified the listed mesh attributes
                        will be saved in the output file
                        The param <opt_mask> can be a space-separated
                        list of the following attributes:
                          vc -> vertex colors,
                          vf -> vertex flags,
                          vq -> vertex quality,
                          vn-> vertex normals,
                          vt -> vertex texture coords,
                          vr -> vertex radius,
                          fc -> face colors,
                          ff -> face flags,
                          fq -> face quality,
                          fn-> face normals,
                          wc -> wedge colors,
                          wn-> wedge normals,
                          wt -> wedge texture coords,
                          mp -> polygonal mesh info

    -s filename         the script to be applied


   Examples:

'meshlabserver -i input.obj -o output.ply -m vc fq wt -s meshclean.mlx'
           the script contained in file 'meshclean.mlx' will be applied
           to the mesh contained into 'input.obj'. The per-vertex-color,
           the per-face-quality and the per-wedge-texture attributes 
           contained in the current layer will be saved into the
           output.ply file

'meshlabserver -i input.obj -o output.ply -l 2 -m vc fq wt -o output_last.ply -l l -s meshclean.mlx'
           the script contained in file 'meshclean.mlx' will be applied
           to the mesh contained into 'input.obj'.
           The per-vertex-color, the per-face-quality and the 
           per-wedge-texture attributes contained in the layer 2 
           (if it exists!) will be saved into the output.ply file
           The last layer of the project will be saved in the file
           output_last, with the default geometric attributes.

'meshlabserver -i input0.obj -i input1.ply -w outproj.mlp -x -s meshclean.mlx'
           the script file meshclean.mlx will be applied to the project
           composed by input0.obj and input1.ply meshes.
           The mesh input1.ply will become the current mesh of the 
           project (e.g. the mesh to which the filters operating on a
           single model will be applied).
           A new output project outproj.mlp file will be generated
           (containing references to the input0.obj an input1.ply).
           The files input0.obj and input1.ply will be overwritten.

'meshlabserver -l logfile.txt -p proj.mlp -i input.obj -w outproj.mlp -s meshclean.mlx'
           the mesh file input.obj will be added to the meshes referred
           by the loaded meshlab project file proj.mlp. The mesh 
           input.obj will become the current mesh of the project, the 
           script file meshclean.mlx will be applied to the meshes
           contained into the resulting project.
           The project file outproj.mlp will be generated.
           A 3D model meshfile.ext contained in the input project 
           proj.mlp will be saved in a new file called meshfile_out.ext.
           (if you want to overwrite the original files use the -v flag
           after the outproject filename) all the attributes of the 
           meshes will be saved into the output files; the log info 
           will be saved into the file logfile.txt.

   Notes:
   There can be multiple meshes loaded and the order they are listed
   matters because filters that use meshes as parameters choose the 
   mesh based on the order.
   The format of the output mesh is guessed by the used extension.
   Script is optional and must be in the xml format saved by MeshLab.
