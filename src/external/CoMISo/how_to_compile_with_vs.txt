- if the GMM_INCLUDE_DIR tag is not presented in CMAKE set the gmm path by hand in cmake/FindGMM.cmake 
(for instance find_path( GMM_INCLUDE_DIR NAMES gmm/gmm.h PATHS $ENV{GMM_DIR}"d:\\code\\gmm-4.2\\include") )

- if EIGEN3 tag is not presented in CMAKE set the gmm path by hand in cmake/FindEIGEN3.cmake 
(for instance find_path( EIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR NAMES Eigen/Dense PATHS $ENV{EIGEN_DIR}) )

- add to the linking path of the CoMISo project properties the static lib generated by GotoBLAS2

- to test the example included with CoMISo go to the example properties and change from Linker->System->SubSystem->Console

- some tests will not compile
