	"Coding styles are like assholes, everyone has one and no one likes anyone else's."
	--Eric Warmenhoven

We're not terribly particular about coding style at this early stage. However,
you should try to follow the following basic guidelines:

=== INDENTATION ===

libfreenect is coded using tabs for indentation. The nominal width is 4 spaces.
However, you are encouraged to use spaces for alignment, as in the following
example:

	if (foo(this, that, there)
	    && bar == baz) {
		dostuff();
	}

Notice the spaces before the second line of the if() condition, after a single
tab. This lets people use their preferred tab width setting while maintaining
alignment.

Do not, however, use spaces for indentation. Always use tabs.

=== WIDTH ===

We're not particular about code width, but 80 characters is a good mark where
you should begin to consider breaking into multiple lines. A few 100 or 120-char
lines are fine, but don't go longer than that. Documentation, if linewrapped,
should be linewrapped to 80 character lines.

=== IF / FOR / WHILE / etc. ===

Put the opening brace on the same line, like this:

	if (foo) {
		...
	} else if (bar) {
		...
	} else {
		...
	}

Or don't use braces for single-line bodies, like this:

	if (foo)
		...
	else if (bar)
		...
	else
		...

Exceptions are allowed when the if() condition spans multiple lines and putting
the brace on its own line looks better by visually separating the condition from
the body.

=== FUNCTIONS ===

Functions should have the opening brace on the next line, like this:

void foo(int a_thing, int something_else)
{
	...
}

No-args functions should be (void), and function arguments should be separated
with a space after the comma, like this:

void baz(void)
{
	foo(bluh, blah);
}

Try to avoid having excessively long function names (abbreviating is fine) and
don't make multiple functions that do essentially the same thing (and certainly
don't copy and paste the code).

In general, for data obtained with the Kinect, we'll provide a raw and a
"cooked" variant, where it makes sense, but we don't need to support every
"cooked" value convention under the sun.

== WHITESPACE ===

Avoid trailing whitespace. No lines should end in a tab or a space. Keep a
newline (blank line) at the end of each file.
