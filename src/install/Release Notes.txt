MeshLab Release Note

** Every Time you commit something significant add a few lines here. 
** Be Descriptive please. 


2014 04 08 Corrected Selection Bug. 
Old and low-end graphics cards (like the integrated intel ones) do not support OpenGL selection modes. Re-implemented all the selection using a internal pipeline that is actually faster.

2014 04 18 New MeshLabServer version has been committed
MeshLabServer is now able to properly manage the MeshLab Project files. MeshLabServer has been completely rewritten in order (hopefully) to enhance the robustness and usability of the tool 

2014 04 25 Improved on screen Help. 
Now it reports the trick for quick visibility toggling in the Layer window.

2014 04 28 Corrected Missing Preview Bug
The preview check box disappeared from many filters that were changing just the geometry of the mesh (like all the smoothing filters) without any serious reason.

2014 05 13 Added support for xml filters in the old fashioned scripting system=======

2014 04 30 Improved selection-by-quality filters
Now they consistently works also for point clouds. 

2014 04 30 Improved Computation of normals for point clouds
In the case of working with point clouds generated with the well known Bundler, we added the options to reorient the vertex normals to comply with the cameras in Bundler datasets that have a camera attribute 

2014 05 06 Obj File Export. 
Added support of polygonal meshes in OBJ  output. Now meshes with faux edges set are correctly exported as polygonal meshes (and not tris)

2014 05 07 OFF File Import
Corrected bug in the faux edge setting when loading polygonal meshes. 

2014 05 07 Faux Edge Decorator
Added control of width of the drawn line.	

2014 05 13 MeshLab core
Added support for xml filters in the old fashioned scripting system

2014 05 15 Create Sphere Cap
Added another basic shape (tessellated spherical cap).

2014 05 15 Invert Face Filter
Corrected bug in filter inverting faces that messed the faux bit flag.

2014 05 23 Sampling Filter
Improved Montecarlo, added weighted montecarlo 
Improved Poisson weighting scheme (now it is coherent with the montecarlo one) 
Combined the variable disk and standard poisson disk sampling
Added option for obtaining an exact number of samples (very useful when you want to get a very low number of samples)

2014 05 23 Added Point Cloud Simplification Filter
Easy to use filter for uniformly simplifying point clouds. 

2014 05 23  Improved normal computation for polygonal face. 

2014 05 23 Quality for face
Added two new measures for measuring the planarity of polygonal faces. 

2014 05 23 Compute Measures
Improved quality of the results formatting and report more useful info (edge Length sum)
Improved support of polygonal meshes 

2014 06 17 Decorators and Interface
Added possibility of choosing the color of the text, useful when showing info, histograms and such on white backgrounds. 
Exposed color of NonFaux Edges

2014 06 17 Colorize by face color
Corrected small bug in the percentile filtering

2014 06 17 Filter Change: Create->Random Sphere now is  Create->Point on a Sphere
It allows the creation of points randomly generated using a Poisson Disk distribution or using the Dave Rusin's disco ball algorithm for the regular placement of points on a sphere.

2014 06 17 New Filter: Build a Polyline with NonFaux Edges
Create a new Layer with an edge mesh composed only by the non faux edges of the current mesh
