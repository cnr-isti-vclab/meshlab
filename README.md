This is the official repository for the sources and the binaries of MeshLab. 

MeshLab is an open source, portable, and extensible system for the processing and editing of unstructured large 3D triangular meshes. The source is released under the GPL license.
The system is aimed to help the processing of the typical not-so-small unstructured models arising in 3D scanning, providing a set of tools for editing, cleaning, healing, inspecting, rendering and converting this kind of meshes. 

MeshLab is mostly based on the open source c++ mesh processing library [VCGlib](http://www.vcglib.net) developed at the [Visual Computing Lab](http://vcg.isti.cnr.it) of [ISTI - CNR](http://www.isti.cnr.it), for all the core mesh processing tasks and it is available for Windows, MacOSX, and Linux. 

Compiling instruction can be found in the [src](https://github.com/cnr-isti-vclab/meshlab/tree/master/src) folder.
